# Rhythm Invasion

## Concept statement
  Protect the realm from otherworldly creatures with unnatural sense of rhythm.
## Genre
  Lane-based rhythm game
## Target Audience
  This game targets people who want to challenge their sense of rhythm and hand eye coordination.
## Unique Selling Point
  A rhythm game in 2.5D with exceptional music taste? Who could say no?
## Player Experience
  A mysterious portal has opened and enemies are pouring through it. Luckily they move to the beat of great rock songs, so defeating them should not be that big of a problem. 
## Visual and Audio Style
  Combining neon cyberpunk with elements from hell, while classic rock song plays in the background. Shall I say more?
## Game World Fiction
  In a cyberpunk world, where neon is the best personality trait, a mysterious portal opens and long forgotten rock songs play. These demons did not come to play. They came to dance.
## Platform
  The game is designed to be played mainly on PC, with keyboard and mouse inputs, but mobile and console supports can be also made. 2.5D in Unity is a great way to make a playable version quite quickly, while also keeping the possibility for expansion open for the future.
## Objectives and Progression
  Players need to focus constantly on the beat as the constant flow of enemies will only stop when the song ends. Their goal is to hit every enemy that gets too close, collecting points for hits, combos, but losing points for misses. 
## Monetization
  I do not want to make players pay for every level they can play, but there could be some that are only available behind a paywall. These could contain different types of enemies, custom songs or custom maps.
## Interactivity
  On every single user input, feedback is instantaneously issued. Hits and misses both result in a score change, signified by little indicators flying over the score display. This instant feedback system should make the game more rewarding with people that have attention deficit disorders, like ADHD, as every action is instantly evaluated, reducing the strain on their minds when they are wondering that whether they are doing the right thing or not.
