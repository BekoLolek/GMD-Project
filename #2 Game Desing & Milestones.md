Game Design

This game is an epic crossover between Subway Surfers and Beatsaber. The main concept is for the player to navigate an obstacle courses to the rhythm of popular rock songs.

Controls:
  Movement: the player is can move alongisde 3 lanes, hold the stick to go to the sides, release to stay in the middle
  Actions: buttons for dodge, block and attack

Scoring:
  Constant score for playing
  Penalty for failing to do an action (missing dodge, getting hit)
  Multiplier for beat hits (separate score to be added to total to avoid really high end score)
  Plus score for enemies killed and boss damage done
  Plus 100 if your name is "Lolek"

I plan to create 3 maps:
  Nightmare by Avenged Sevenfold - 125 BPM - 6:03 minutes
  Pretender by Foo Fighters - 105 BOM - 4:29 minutes
  Square Hammer by Ghost - 92 BPM - 4:03 minutes

These songs have different Beats Per Minute and also lengths, this is a great way to categorize them in terms of difficulty.

Themes:
  Nightmare: nightmare, weird figures, shadows, darkness, pulsing red lighting
  Pretender: ???
  Square Hammer: gothic church, ghosts, swinging lanterns, boulders, spiky pendulums, like Sagrada Familia

Map breakdown:
  Nightmare: in development
  Pretender: in development

  Square Hammer:
    Stage 1:
      Focused on movement, mainly an obstacle course to get the player familiar with the concept and provide a sense of tutorial
    Stage 2:
      Enemies appear:
        Weak: kill with attack
        Shield: dodge
        Mage: block
    Stage 3:
      Bossfight:
        Boss attacks, block them to charge up your attack (gameplay wise it does not matter if you miss anything, it will not have any impact on other phases)
        Damage the boss from the destinated spots on rhythm

  Song breakdown:
    0:30: slow
    1:00: chorus
    1:30: slow
    1:59:
    2:36: guitar solo
    3:05: chorus
    3:54: end and fade out


Development Milestones:
  Milestone 1: Sync player speed and obstacle / enemy positions with beats in the song 
  Milestone 2: Sort out animations for the player, enemies and map
  Milestone 3: Add 2 more maps
  Milestone 4: Finished game with 3 maps
